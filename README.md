# Coding Practice Repository

Welcome to the Coding Practice repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing different fundamental topics of code using C++, Python, and Java. Whether you are a beginner looking to enhance your programming skills or an experienced developer brushing up on the basics, this repository aims to provide exercises and examples to help you improve.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured way to practice various fundamental topics of coding such as data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more. Each language (C++, Python, Java) has its own set of exercises and examples organized within the repository.

## Languages Covered

This repository covers exercises and examples in the following programming languages:

- C++
- Python
- Java

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **C++**
  - Contains exercises and examples implemented in C++.
- **Python**
  - Contains exercises and examples implemented in Python.
- **Java**
  - Contains exercises and examples implemented in Java.

Each language folder further categorizes topics based on different fundamental concepts, such as:

- Data Structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
- Object-Oriented Programming (e.g., classes, inheritance, polymorphism)

Feel free to explore the folders and dive into the topics you want to practice.


### Pointers

-   **[Introduction to Pointers](C++/PointersAndMemory/00pointer.md)**: Covers the basics of what pointers are, how to declare, initialize, and dereference them.

### Dynamic Memory Management

-   **[Heap Persistence & Leaks](C++/PointersAndMemory/1Dynamipc.md)**: Explains how heap memory persists and the critical importance of avoiding memory leaks.
    -   *Code:* `[1dynamic.cpp](C++/PointersAndMemory/1dynamic.cpp)`
-   **[Stack Memory & Dangling Pointers](C++/PointersAndMemory/2StackMemory.md)**: Demonstrates how stack memory works and the danger of dangling pointers.
    -   *Code:* `[2staticMemory.cpp](C++/PointersAndMemory/2staticMemory.cpp)`
-   **[Stack vs. Heap Comparison](C++/PointersAndMemory/3dynamicVsStatic.md)**: A detailed comparison of static (Stack) and dynamic (Heap) memory allocation.
-   **[Dynamic Array Creation & Return](C++/PointersAndMemory/4dynamicArrayCreation.md)**: Shows how to create dynamic arrays and return them from functions.
    -   *Code:* `[4dynamicArrayCreate.cpp](C++/PointersAndMemory/4dynamicArrayCreate.cpp)`
    -   *Code (Returning with Size):* `[4DynamicArrayReturn.cpp](C++/PointersAndMemory/4DynamicArrayReturn.cpp)`
    -   *Code (Incorrect Static Return - **Do Not Do This!**):* `[staticArrayReturnFromfunc.cpp](C++/PointersAndMemory/staticArrayReturnFromfunc.cpp)`
-   **[Handling Dynamic Arrays (Leaks & Dangling Pointers)](C++/PointersAndMemory/4dynamicMemory.md)**: Discusses common pitfalls like using memory after `delete[]`.
    -   *Code (Demonstrating the issue):* `[4dynamicArray.cpp](C++/PointersAndMemory/4dynamicArray.cpp)`
-   **[Resizing Dynamic Arrays](C++/PointersAndMemory/5DynamicArray.md)**: Explains the manual process for increasing the size of a dynamic array (and why `std::vector` is usually better).
    -   *Code (Example 1):* `[5extendSizeOfDynamicArray.cpp](C++/PointersAndMemory/5extendSizeOfDynamicArray.cpp)`
    -   *Code (Example 2):* `[resizeArry.cpp](C++/PointersAndMemory/resizeArry.cpp)`

**Important:** You *must* replace `C++/PointersAndMemory/` with the actual path to your files in your repository. If you put them directly in the `C++` folder, the path would just be `C++/00pointer.md`, for example.

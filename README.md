## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured way to practice various fundamental topics of coding such as data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more. Each language (C++, Python, Java) has its own set of exercises and examples organized within the repository.

## Languages Covered

This repository covers exercises and examples in the following programming languages:

- C++
- Python
- Java

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **C++**
  - Contains exercises and examples implemented in C++.
- **Python**
  - Contains exercises and examples implemented in Python.
- **Java**
  - Contains exercises and examples implemented in Java.

Each language folder further categorizes topics based on different fundamental concepts, such as:

- Data Structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
- Object-Oriented Programming (e.g., classes, inheritance, polymorphism)

Feel free to explore the folders and dive into the topics you want to practice.

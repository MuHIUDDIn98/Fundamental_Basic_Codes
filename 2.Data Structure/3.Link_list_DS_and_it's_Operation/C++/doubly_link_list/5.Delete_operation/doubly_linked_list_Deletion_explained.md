# Doubly Linked List Deletion Code Explanation

This document explains the structure and functionality of the C++ program implementing a doubly linked list with deletion operations.

---

## üìå Overview
The code defines a `Node` class for a doubly linked list and implements deletion operations:
- Delete at head
- Delete at tail
- Delete at a specific position

It also includes functions for:
- Printing the list in forward and reverse
- Calculating size of the list

---

## üß± Structure

### Class: `Node`
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int value;
    Node *next;
    Node *prev;

    Node(int value) {
        this->value = value;
        this->next = NULL;
        this->prev = NULL;
    }
};
```
Each node stores:
- An `int` value
- A pointer to the next node (`next`)
- A pointer to the previous node (`prev`)

---

## üîÅ Utility Functions

### `print_link_list(Node *head)`
Prints the linked list from head to tail.

### `reverse_print_link_list(Node *tail)`
Prints the list from tail to head.

### `size(Node *head)`
Counts the total number of nodes in the list.

---

## ‚ùå Deletion Functions

### `delete_at_tail(Node *&head, Node *&tail)`
Deletes the last node of the list.
- Handles edge case: if there's only one node, resets both `head` and `tail` to `NULL`.

### `delte_at_head(Node *&head, Node *&tail)`
Deletes the first node of the list.
- Handles edge case: when head == tail (one node only).

### `delte_at_position(Node *&head, Node *&tail, int pos)`
Deletes the node at a specific index (0-based).
- Checks for invalid index.
- Calls head/tail deletion functions if position is at ends.
- Updates links in the middle for safe deletion.

---

## üîÅ Main Function Logic

### Initial List Creation
```cpp
Node *head = new Node(11);
Node *a = new Node(12); ... Node *e = new Node(16);
// Manual linking of next and prev pointers.
```
Creates a sample list:
```
11 <-> 12 <-> 13 <-> 14 <-> 15 <-> 16
```

### User Menu
```cpp
while(true) {
    // Menu: Delete or Exit
    // User inputs position
    // Calls delte_at_position()
    // Reprints list forward & backward
}
```
Interactive menu allows the user to:
- Delete node by index
- Print the updated list
- Exit loop

### Cleanup
```cpp
while (head != NULL) {
    delte_at_head(head, tail);
}
```
Cleans up all remaining nodes before exiting.

---

## ‚úÖ Edge Cases Handled
- Deletion from an empty list (does nothing).
- Deletion of the only node (head == tail).
- Invalid index check in `delte_at_position()`.

---

## üìò Example Output
```
11 12 13 14 15 16
16 15 14 13 12 11
Size of linked list: 6
To exit press '0', to delete press '1': 1
Enter your desired position to delete: 3
11 12 13 15 16
16 15 13 12 11
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
This program demonstrates proper implementation of deletion in a doubly linked list with safe pointer management and edge-case handling. It uses clear logic to avoid segmentation faults and provides a good example of memory-safe dynamic data structure operations in C++.
